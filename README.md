# RaidBoss

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9.

This project allows me to play the raid boss abilities in a PvE format for Magic the Gathering.

Here's the YouTube video explaining how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7YcAIiNF0
